 - Localization (development in progress);

Localization
-------

There only localization what may be needed is for names of days of week.

(here should be instructions when it's done)

 
How to port to other framework?
--------

It's should be easy. Most of business logic placed in `./src/classes` dir, and `angular_directive.ts` only works with 
DOM. You may easily replace it with any other view implementation.

Contribution
--------

All contributions are welcome. Please add a [Pull-Request][5].
If you not sure about TypeScript, you ay wrote your PR in JS (it's will be easy to port after all).

You may found few hand-test cases in [dev-server][6] branch. It will be better if you test how it works on it.

 
How it works (for users)
--------

(how it resolve conflicts of limits and datetime, only datetime has mean, what data provided in model, etc...)
 
How it works (for developers)
---------
 
 (should write basics of apd)
